## :notebook: About
This is the web aplication for Ikebana Sanguetsu App, my first full featured and production ready Web application.
It is the result of an idea i had for helping [Fundação Mokiti Okada](https://fmo.org.br), delivering more accessibility to Ikebana Sanguetsu teachers and students.
It's live at https://fabricio7p.com.br but not currently adopted by the organization, hence being hosted at my personal domain.
**The main purpose is to host Ikebana related lessons and provide avaiability to whoever desires to learn. For teachers, it is a place to share their work and knowledge.**
